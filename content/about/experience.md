        * Developing and supporting data pipelines (initial implementation, SMS platform and
          Google Forms configuration, daily pipeline execution, maintenance, uploading of coding
          schemes to aid in data labelling, SMS traffic monitoring; code reviews/standing in for
          primaries on leave etc.)

        * Building, running and maintaining new data processing pipelines and infrastructure using
          existing core modules.

        * Providing support in core infrastructural investments in between projects.

        * In charge of creating, co-designing, maintaining and testing SMS flow on the Textit
          platform.

          products.

        * Collaborating with Data and Technology staff to build and maintain core AVF
          infrastructure and systems.

        * Supporting standard software engineering skills (code review, debugging, testing, etc.)

        * Collaborated with other engineers to build a centralised Firebase database that provides a
          canonical view of our contacts, engagements, and their respective demographics.
          This helped reduce operational costs from 3rd-party data management services and
          improved how we store and interact with our vast citizen-generated data from various
          countries, donors and contexts.

          operators, and message coding progress.

        * Gathered user feedback both within and outside the organisation on ways of improving
          the dashboard further. This became the go-to tool within the organisation for
          monitoring critical project processes and tasks.

        * Provided technical support and maintenance to enable the smooth running of operations
          in the organisation including assisting colleagues in resolving technical issues; actively
          updated, maintained and monitored AVF computers, 3rd party software, networks and

          mitigate them in the future proactively.
          
        * Learnt AVFâ€™s pipeline codebase and created a test pipeline.

        * Collaborated with other software engineers and researchers to co-pilot pipeline
          operations.

        * Monitored deployments, tracked outages, and provided root cause analysis and
          postmortem solutions for incident responses.

        * Documented existing operational processes and developed new ones as the infrastructure
          grew.

        * Collaborated with project leads to establish technical and operational plans for
          deployments.
